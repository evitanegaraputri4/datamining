This project aim to predict the quality measurement of wine based on physicochemical properties and quality ratings using two different data mining techniques. The ensemble and dimensionality reduction methods have been used to predict the red wine test. The test aims to identify the most accurate method for predicting wine quality. The prediction result can serve as insight to improve the quality of wine. The dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality
